# AWS Nested Account Discovery

This script is designed to check once every 24 hours for new accounts underneath the umbrella of an "AWS Organizations" account and integrate them into Morpheus. The process is automated using Morpheus concepts of Tasks, Jobs, Cypher, as well as Morpheus integration with a Github repository. Additional details on implementation of this solution can be reviewed in our [whitepaper](https://morpheusdata.com/wp-content/uploads/content/Morpheus-Whitepaper-Cloud-Account-Discovery.pdf) on the subject.
